# Implemented pattern
### **Factory Method** - is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

We dicided to use factory method to be able to initialize both types of shops(Food and Health).
**What is why** we have **Factory method** and **FoodMethod + HealthMood** classes which extend from FactoryMethod.
